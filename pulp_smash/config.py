"""Tools for managing information about test systems.

Pulp Smash needs to know what servers it can talk to and how to talk to those
systems. For example, it needs to know the protocol, hostname and port of a
Pulp server (e.g. 'https://example.com:250') and how to authenticate with that
server. :class:`pulp_smash.config.ServerConfig` eases the task of managing that
information.

class ServerConfig(object):
    """Facts about a server, plus methods for manipulating those facts.

    This object stores a set of facts that are used when communicating with a
    Pulp server. A typical usage of this object is as follows:

    >>> import requests
    >>> from pulp_smash.config import ServerConfig
    >>> cfg = ServerConfig(
    ...     base_url='https://pulp.example.com',
    ...     auth=('username', 'password'),
    ...     verify=False,  # Disable SSL verification
    ... )
    >>> response = requests.post(
    ...     cfg.base_url + '/pulp/api/v2/actions/login/',
    ...     **cfg.get_requests_kwargs()
    ... )

    One can also :meth:`save` a ``ServerConfig`` out to a file, :meth:`read`
    one back and more. By way of example, assume that a file with the following
    contents exists on the filesystem::

        {
          "default": {"base_url": "example.com", "auth": ["alice", "hackme"]},
          "alternate": {"base_url": "example.org", "auth": ["bob", "hackme"]},
        }

    The two top-level sections can be read like so:

    >>> from pulp_smash.config import ServerConfig
    >>> 'example.com' == ServerConfig().read('default').base_url
    >>> 'example.org' == ServerConfig().read('alternate').base_url

    By default, :meth:`read` reads the "default" section. As a result, this
    holds true:

    >>> from pulp_smash.config import ServerConfig
    >>> ServerConfig().read() == ServerConfig().read('default')
    >>> ServerConfig().read() != ServerConfig().read('alternate')

    All methods dealing with files obey the `XDG Base Directory Specification
    <http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>`_.
    Please read the specification for insight into the logic of those methods.

    In addition, the file-facing methods respect the ``PULP_SMASH_CONFIG_FILE``
    environment variable. By default, the methods work with a file named
    ``settings.json``, but the environment variable overrides that default. If
    set, the environment variable should be a file name like ``settings2.json``
    (or a relative path), *not* an absolute path.

    :param base_url: A string. A protocol, hostname and optionally a port. For
        example, ``'http://example.com:250'``. Do not append a trailing slash.
    :param auth: A two-tuple. Credentials to use when communicating with the
        server. For example: ``('username', 'password')``.
    :param verify: A boolean. Should SSL be verified when communicating with
        the server?
